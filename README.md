# Cpp-Calculators
These are pre-compiled calculators that run on any device without the need of installing any language editors!

### My Works
1. QuadS
    
    QuadS is a C++ calculator to solve Quadratic equations...
    
    Click [here](https://github.com/AmithS01/Mega-Calculators/blob/master/QuadS.HTML) for the HTML executable file written in Python.

2. Circle Solver
    
    This is a C++ calculator to solve Circle completely...All you need to input is your name(For better interactions) and the radius! It will automatically give :
    1. Diameter 
    2. Circumference 
    3. Area
    
    Sorry... This project is not written in python...

3. Tables
    
    This is a C++ to print tables of any desired number you need...All you need to input is your name(For better interactions) and the number(x)! It will automatically give tables of the number(x) till x×20!
    
    Sorry... This project is not written in python...

#### Warning ⚠ 
1. You must enter your name in this unlike before's Python version calc!
2. Trust me... it is not a virus tho the Windows SmartScreen or Antivirus may block it (Due to .exe extention)...
